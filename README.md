# LESS TextMate bundle

Syntax highlighting for `.less` files. To learn more about [LESS][], see <http://lesscss.org/docs.html>.

This bundle was forked from `appden/less.tmbundle` but has since been rewritten from scratch (the language syntax).

[`sample.less`](http://github.com/rsms/less.tmbundle/blob/master/sample.less):

## Compiling to CSS (âŒ˜S)

Runs `lessc` on the current file, saving to the same file name with a .css extension (e.g. style.less => style.css).

Depencies of that .less file in the project directory will also be compiled (found by `@import` statements).

Will **not** compile .less files that are .erb.less files.

Compiling requires some version of `lessc` to be in your `PATH`.
